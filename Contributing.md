# Contributing with “perfect” grammar

The only requirement for contributing to this repository is to have some sort of grammar checking tool. \
I personally use and recommend using [LTeX](https://valentjn.github.io/vscode-ltex/), the `.vscode` directory already has all the configurations needed for using LTeX.
